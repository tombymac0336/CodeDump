So, to resolve, you can either deploy a TS to this client (add the client to a collection where a TS is deployed), or, you can delete the client record from ConfigMgr.

You may need to query (via console query/WQL, or, via SQL) to find the client record.

I use a console WQL query for these situations. sometimes a client record exists, but not with a hostname/computername that I am expecting.
SELECT SMS_R_System.MACAddresses
	,SMS_R_System.SMBIOSGUID
	,SMS_R_System.ResourceNames
	,SMS_R_System.ResourceId
FROM SMS_R_System
WHERE SMS_R_System.MACAddresses LIKE '%FC:B3:9D'

-- the last 3 octets of the MAC address --
